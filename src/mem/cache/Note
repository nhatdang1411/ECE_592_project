1. We will use non coherent cache for the project

2. Base cache

  Base cache receive a request from CPU side
  -> recvTimingReq
    -> access (return if cache hit or miss, return writeback if the packet is wb type)
    -> doWritebacks (forward to write buffer)
      -> allocateWriteBuffer
        -> writeBuffer.allocate()
        -> schedMemSideSendEvent()
    If cache miss
      -> handleTimingReqMiss
         if MSHR
         -> allocateWriteBuffer
         else
         -> allocateMissBuffer
          -> schedMemSideSendEvent()
  -> recvTimingResp
    -> handleFill (update writeback)
      -> allocateBlock() (Update writeback)
    -> doWritebacks (forward to write buffer)
      -> allocateWriteBuffer
        -> writeBuffer.allocate()
        -> schedMemSideSendEvent()

3. Implementation
  Create a pointer to MT cache and Counter cache
  Base cache receive a request from CPU side
  -> recvTimingReq
    -> access (return if cache hit or miss, return writeback if the packet is wb type)
       if (cache miss)
        -> CT cache -> access (return if counter cache hit or miss)
        -> MT cache -> access (return if MT cache hit or miss)
    -> doWritebacks (forward to write buffer)
      -> allocateWriteBuffer
        -> writeBuffer.allocate()
        -> schedMemSideSendEvent()
    If cache miss
      -> handleTimingReqMiss
         if MSHR
         -> allocateWriteBuffer
         else
         -> allocateMissBuffer
          -> schedMemSideSendEvent()
  -> recvTimingResp
    -> handleFill (update writeback)
      -> allocateBlock() (Update writeback)
    -> doWritebacks (forward to write buffer)
      -> allocateWriteBuffer
        -> writeBuffer.allocate()
        -> schedMemSideSendEvent()

4. Question
 + How to add latency for data MAC and encryption
  + If it is a write access then reschedule the event to MEM at a later time
  + If it is a read access then reschedule the event to CPU at a later time
 + How to implement MT cache access
  + Write a new function for MT cache access

  5. TO DO
   + Implement change in MT cache access, counter cache access
   + Implement change in handleTimingReqMiss for counter and MT cache
   + Implement change in recvTimingResp for counter and MT cache
   + Add stats for merkle tree cache and counter cache
